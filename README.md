# humanornot

A collection of python files i use to do tricks with the [Human or Not](https://humanornot.ai) website, such as HTML injection.
This is not official in any way.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> HTML injection in Human or Not is patched. This repository is completely useless now.
> It will still be up for anyone wanting the source code.

For information about certain things, read the [wiki](https://github.com/likelyrand/humanornot/wiki). Most pages will say HorN instead of Human or Not.

If you need help about something, contact me on discord: `@likelyrand`.
