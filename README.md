# humanornot

A collection of python files i use to do tricks with the Human or Not (humanornot.ai) website, such as HTML injection.
This is not official in any way.


## html

HTML injection stuff.


### image.py

Converts image links (such as https://i.imgur.com/7x9ejFZ.png) into HTML to paste into HorN.
Imgur is most recommended for this.
