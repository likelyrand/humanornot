# humanornot

A collection of python files i use to do tricks with the [Human or Not](https://humanornot.ai) website, such as HTML injection.
This is not official in any way.


## html

These files convert links into HTML to paste into HorN.
They will be updated in the future.
> [!WARNING]
> HTML injection may be patched in the future, so this may not work.

### universal.py

Converts any valid link into HTML to paste into HorN.
Works for images, audio and videos. When more testing is done, more file extensions will be supported.

### image.py

Converts image links (such as https://i.imgur.com/7x9ejFZ.png) into HTML to paste into HorN.
Imgur is most recommended for this.

### video.py

Converts video links (no example yet) into HTML to paste into HorN.

### audio.py

Converts audio links (no example yet) into HTML to paste into HorN.








# What's next?

## More HTML tricks

I want to implement bold text and so on.

## Bot examples

When i eventually figure out how to make bots, I want to make some examples for people to use.
